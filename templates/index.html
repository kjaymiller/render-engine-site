            Web technology has evolved since the early days of the internet. But
            deep down at its core, every website, no matter how complex, has to
            reply back with pure HTML. In fact, most websites we visit once
            loaded no longer needs to pull information from a server and can
            exist exactly how it is presented.

        <div class="content">
            <p>Render Engine's components build off of one another.</p>
            <p>At the base level there is a <strong>Page</strong>, it is just that a single
            entity of HTML and metadata goodness.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a lot of pages will have a lot in common or belong to
            a group. We call these <strong>Collections</strong>. Collections
            can have any number of the same, or different attributes. Oh and
            your collections can even have collections...ðŸ¤¯</p>
            <p>All of these pages we build need a home. We call that a
            <strong>Site</strong>. A site serves as a container for your pages
            controlling it's structure and how pages are built.</p>
            <p>Last but not least is the Engine. And engine is what is doing
            the work building out your pages from the data and templates that
            you have provided it. How do you start that engine? Simple.</p>

          <p>Render Engine support many Page and Collection types like Blogs
          and Microblogs even supporting RSS Feeds</p>

          Render Engine is built using tools that engineered for you to write
          fast content using the Jinja2 templating engine and the ability to
          parse markdown.
          </p>
          <p>
          Rendered sites are served in raw HTML so there are no multiple
          requests to the server or waiting to fetch data from several
          locations. (Unless you want it to...)
